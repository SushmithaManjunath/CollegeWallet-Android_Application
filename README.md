# CollegeWallet-Android_Application
A mobile based smart cashless assistant for a student in the college scenario.
College Wallette aims to be designed as a mobile (preferably android) application that allows an individual to make cashless transactions. 
This can include making payments like library dues, exam fee, canteen bills, hostel bills using a smartphone.
Increasingly, college wallets can be used not just for basic financial transactions but also to authenticate the students' credentials. 
One can approach the term college wallet not as a singular technology but as three major parts: the system (the database), 
the application (the software that operates on top) and the device (the smartphone)
Ensuring each transaction is secure using authentication and One Time Password (OTP) mechanisms
Making provisions for speedy and internet free transactions
Designing an easy to use and attractive interface for the users and providers
Designing and development of a normalized database for the proper interaction of all the modules involved. 
Allowing location and timing constraints to be incorporated in the billing mechanism
